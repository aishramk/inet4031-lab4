# INET4031 Lab 4 Website

This repository contains the Lab 4 web page for INET 4031. The goal of this lab is to understand how HTML and JavaScript work together to create an interactive webpage. The page includes a simple example where clicking buttons can turn a lightbulb on and off. This shows how JavaScript can change HTML elements directly from the browser. 

The repository includes:
- `webpagewithjs.html` – The main web page with HTML and JavaScript.
- `pic_bulbon.gif` and `pic_bulboff.gif` – Images used for the lightbulb animation.
